# ElixirTutor

🚨🚨🚨 WARNING: This app was completely vibe-coded to help make learning Enum functions fun and engaging, so please use at your own risk. 🚨🚨🚨

There are most certainly bugs. For example, closing your browser will erase your progress. Maybe I will add better auth to fix this in a future update...

Right now (11/20/2025) I'm focused on learning the fundamentals of Elixir/OTP. However, I plan to learn Phoenix as soon as I feel grounded. At that time I would be delighted to squash some bugs and improve the overall UX/UI. But until then, I'm just using this as a fun tool to get exposure to Enum functions and to learn how to use all of them. Maybe I will come back and add other Elixir modules as well. :)

Additionally, I built this on nix-darwin and have no idea if this will easily build on other systems. I will proabbly put it on a flake-based NixOS machine soon and would be happy to provide build instructions. But for all other systems, YMMV. 

I don't know if I put a license on this thing. It's just a fun project and I don't care what you do with it. If you want to have some fun with it, make changes, sell it, I don't care -- go for it!

Everything below this line was probably genereated as boiler plate by Claude Code or Phoenix, I really don't know. Thanks for checking this out and have fun!

To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
